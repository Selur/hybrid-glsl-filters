#define SHARPENING 0.0 // Adjusts the range the shader adapts to high contrast (0 is not all the way off).  Higher values = more high contrast sharpening. 0.0 to 1.0.
// Performance
#define CAS_BETTER_DIAGONALS 1 // If set to 0, drops certain math and texture lookup operations for better performance. This is only useful on pre-OpenGL 4.0 renderers and there is no need to disable it otherwise. 0 or 1.
#define CAS_GO_SLOWER 0 // If set to 1, disables the use of optimized approximate transcendental functions which might slightly increase accuracy in exchange of performance. 0 or 1.
