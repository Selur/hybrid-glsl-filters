#define INTENSITY_SIGMA 0.1 //Intensity window size, higher is stronger denoise, must be a positive real number
#define SPATIAL_SIGMA 1.0 //Spatial window size, higher is stronger denoise, must be a positive real number.
#define HISTOGRAM_REGULARIZATION 0.2 //Histogram regularization window size, higher values approximate a bilateral "closest-to-mean" filter.
#define INTENSITY_POWER_CURVE 1.0 //Intensity window power curve. Setting it to 0 will make the intensity window treat all intensities equally, while increasing it will make the window narrower in darker intensities and wider in brighter intensities.
